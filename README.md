# FOMO

Use devise, koala, and Facebook Graph API to grab the user's events

Original plan was to create an app that can pull my events but I wanted to also be able to scroll through recommended events and saved events thus bypassing the productivity sucker called News Feed. This was to test if I could do it before I created a mobile app but FB Graph API only allows you to grab events that you have indicated that are interested, attending or declined. Invited, recommended, and saved events can't be pulled. Thus...this project is now dead...RIP
